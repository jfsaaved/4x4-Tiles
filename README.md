Creating an Android game from scratch using the libgdx framework.

### The Game
The idea of the game is to show a pattern (selected from a list of patterns) to a user and the user has to imitate the same pattern. User gets points by hitting the right tiles. Running out of time or hitting the wrong tiles result in a game over.

### Running
- [Setup your development environment](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
- Clone the repository or download and extract the ZIP file
- Import project into preferred development environment
