Creating an Android game from scratch using the libgdx framework.


### The Game
The idea of the game is to show a pattern (selected from a list of patterns) to a user and the user has to imitate the same pattern. User gets points by hitting the right tiles. Running out of time or hitting the wrong tiles result in a game over.
